## 🎮 Project Overview

**Fish Dude** is a 1992 Game Boy game featuring a small fish trying to survive in the ocean. This project aims to dissect the original game, understand its mechanics, and enhance it by introducing new gameplay elements, mechanics, and goals similar to the *Hungry Shark* series — where you grow by eating smaller fish and avoiding larger predators.
